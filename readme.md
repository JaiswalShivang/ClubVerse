### 📁 **Key Directories and Files**:

- **`app/(roles)/`**: This is the core of the role-based architecture. Each directory contains the specific dashboard and pages for a user role.
- **`app/page.tsx`**: The public-facing landing page. It also handles redirecting logged-in users to their correct dashboard.
- **`components/ui/`**: Contains all the reusable, low-level UI components from `shadcn/ui`, forming the design system.
- **`hooks/useAuth.tsx`**: A critical file that manages user authentication state across the application. All authentication logic currently resides here.
